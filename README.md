# PUBG-Prediction
In this report, we will show our approach in exploring and predicting final leaderboard placements in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds matches. We first give background information on the video game and context for the problem. We do exploratory data analysis. Afterwards, we perform feature engineering, creating more insightful features that better predict the target variable. We try a variety of models (simple to complex) for predictions: Linear Regression, Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Gradient Boosting LightGBM. We discuss postprocessing of our data to decrease our error. We also discuss the interesting discoveries we made when solving this problem. Finally, we discuss future steps to improve our models.
